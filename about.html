  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
  <p> Virtuoso sound designer and auteur Jeff Darby’s approach toward all of his projects is a combination of non-literal sound design and extreme measures, which is influenced heavily by his fine art sensibilities. The end result is a body of work that is highly successful because of its cinematically stylized uniqueness.

Trained as a visual artist, and a California native, Jeff received his Bachelor of Fine Arts with high distinction in Film/Video/Performance from the California College of Arts and Crafts in 1995. Darb began working with Sound in 1992 while producing his own films, and in 1993 began working with Earwax Productions in San Francisco. In addition to working extensively in the Bay Area independent film community he gravitated toward sound design. Along with numerous film projects he produced a series of highly textural soundscapes that have been featured in numerous galleries and venues, including a permanent exhibition at The San Jose Tech Museum and SIGGRAPH.

Jeff's objective when taking on a new project is to always make sure he hits an emotional chord with his audience and clients. This approach has resulted not only as inventive, but also expansive. His experiments with low-end rumblings lent a pensive beauty to the murky, ocean depths of the 1997 IMAX film WHALES.

Some of Darb’s Past Audio Credits in film include " Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within", "Supernova" and Finland’s Avant-garde "Asphalto, an Aria for 13 Gas Stations." Darb has also sound designed many Flash Animations, Wildbrain’s ."Glue" and "Joe Paradise" and a string of successful television comercials such as Goody, Silverstien & Partner’s now classic "Budweiser Lizards" campaign.

Recent Sound Design Projects include; Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Death Stranding Director's Cut, Playstation 5 Ratchet & Clank:Rift Apart, and Playstation 5 Spider-Man Miles Morales."

While working in Sound Design, Darb continues to make his own films, and has worked as a freelance sound designer with Earwax Productions, Outpost Film Center, Pyramind, and Skywalker Sound.

Aside from constantly altering his own voice for custom sound effects, he has worked several times as voice over talent for MTV as well as an assortment of commercials. Darb is a certified instructor and has lectured at the Expression Center for New Media and the California College of Arts and Crafts.
